RefDNN: a reference drug based neural network for more accurate prediction of anticancer drug resistance

1.RefDNN consists of one DNN and numerous ElasticNet logistic regressors
2.Gene expression data and drug fingerprint data should be transformed into representations. 
	The first process is through ElasticNet, and get the drug resistance labels of an input cell line to M reference drugs.
	The second is the drug structure similarity profile computed by Tanimoto coefficient.
3.Combine the info. from the two vectors by element-wise vector multiplication, called Hadamard product.
4.The final MLP consist of three layers.
5.The Loss of RefDNN is the sumation of two Loss function. One is ElasticNet and another is MLP.
